```
pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
python3 generate_drive_token.py
```

## Deploying on Heroku

- Install [Heroku cli](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
- Login into your heroku account with command:
```
heroku login
```
- Create a new heroku app:
```
heroku create appname	
```
- Select This App in your Heroku-cli: 
```
heroku git:remote -a appname
```
- Change Dyno Stack to a Docker Container:
```
heroku stack:set container
```
- Add Private Credentials and Config Stuff:
```
git add -f credentials.json token.pickle config.env heroku.yml
```
- Commit new changes:
```
git commit -m "Added Creds."
```
- Push Code to Heroku:
```
git push heroku master --force
```
- Restart Worker by these commands:
```
heroku ps:scale worker=0
```
```
heroku ps:scale worker=1	 	
```
Heroku-Note: Doing authorizations ( /authorize command ) through telegram wont be permanent as heroku uses ephemeral filesystem. They will be reset on each dyno boot. As a workaround you can:
- Make a file authorized_chats.txt and write the user names and chat_id of you want to authorize, each separated by new line
- Then force add authorized_chats.txt to git and push it to heroku
```
git add authorized_chats.txt -f
git commit -asm "Added hardcoded authorized_chats.txt"
git push heroku heroku:master
```

## Deploying on Server
- Start docker daemon (skip if already running):
```
sudo dockerd
```
- Build Docker image:
```
sudo docker build . -t search-bot
```
- Run the image:
```
sudo docker run search-bot
```
